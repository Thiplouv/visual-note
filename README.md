# The Visual Note Project
> Welcome to the Visual Note project ! The goal of this project was to create a gui based pronote like software.

This project was initially released by a 3 persons group. This is a senior year highschool project. 

I am the major contributor, but I was highly helped by my father. This was the first time I worked with Python.

It is windows only, due to some tkinter stuff. Feel free to read, and suggest any changes.

Have fun !
